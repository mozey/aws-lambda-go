Notes about working with AWS Lambda functions written in Golang

# [Programming model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model.html)

[Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model-logging.html)

Lambda writes logs to CloudWatch.
By importing the log module, 
Lambda will write additional logging information such as the time stamp.

[Lambda Function Handler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model-handler-types.html#go-programming-model-handler-execution-environment-reuse)

You can declare and modify global variables 
that are independent of your Lambda function's handler code.

# [Running Go AWS Lambda functions locally](https://djhworld.github.io/post/2018/01/27/running-go-aws-lambda-functions-locally/)

Using `lambda.Start` enables performance benefits,
AWS isnâ€™t simply just running your go binary every time a function is invoked,
dependencies load up front so they are warm if your fn is called repeatedly

# [apex/gateway](https://github.com/apex/gateway)

provides a drop-in replacement for net/http's ListenAndServe 
for use in AWS Lambda & API Gateway, 
simply swap it out for gateway.ListenAndServe

Inspired by 
[aws-sam-golang-example](https://github.com/cpliakas/aws-sam-golang-example)

Setup as above then
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mozey/aws-lambda-go/examples/gateway
env APEX_GATEWAY_DISABLED=true go run main.go
GOOS=linux go build -o main && sam local start-api
```

APIGatewayProxyRequestContext contains the information to identify the 
AWS account and resources invoking the Lambda function. 
It also includes Cognito identity information for the caller.
