Notes and examples about AWS Lambda functions written in Golang

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) can extract values from AWS CLI commands
assuming output is set to json, for example

    aws sts get-caller-identity | jq .Account

Examples will usually set env vars with prefix "AWS_" 
for use as params to AWS CLI, to see current values run 

    printenv | grep AWS_

# [Programming model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model.html)

[Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model-logging.html)

Lambda writes logs to CloudWatch.
By importing the log module, 
Lambda will write additional logging information such as the time stamp.

[Lambda Function Handler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model-handler-types.html#go-programming-model-handler-execution-environment-reuse)

You can declare and modify global variables 
that are independent of your Lambda function's handler code.


# [How does lambda run the code?](https://djhworld.github.io/post/2018/01/27/running-go-aws-lambda-functions-locally/)

Using `lambda.Start` enables performance benefits,
AWS isnâ€™t simply just running your go binary every time a function is invoked,
dependencies load up front so they are warm if your fn is called repeatedly
